Project Summary:
This project is a computer graphics application that visualizes our solar system in a realistic 3D environment using fundamental graphics principles. It demonstrates real-time rendering techniques and interactive simulations to enhance understanding of planetary motion and space phenomena.

Key Features:

OpenGL lighting and shadow techniques

Spherical texture mapping for realistic planets

Motion and rotation matrices for orbital movement

Interactive planet focus and animations

Wikipedia integration for educational information

“Gravity Lab” for experimenting with gravitational effects

Dynamic and adaptive user interface design
